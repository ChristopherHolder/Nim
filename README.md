# Nim

Nim is an open source wrapper to web3Py that looks to simplify interaction with ethereum clients. It allows to submit transactions,
deploy smart contract and call methods on deployed smart contracts.

This is done through the abstraction of smart contracts, keys, ethereum accounts and connections into easy to use API.

It has support for Geth Ethereum clients(both local and remote) and infura.io service (distributed ethereum). And for contract serialization.

Nim handles both path #1 and #2 and abstracts them away into easy to use objects. 

# Usage

The best example of how to use this library is to take a look at this project I worked on for a competition: https://github.com/Azure-Agst/hackfsu-2019
 
# To-Do
 - Eth gas station support, for dynamic gas pricing. (Not develop yet)
