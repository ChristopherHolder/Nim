ETHPM
=====

-  parse and validate packages.
-  given a web3 instance provide access to contract factory classes
-  given a web3 instance provide access to all of the deployed contract
   instances for the chain that web3 is connected to.
-  validate package bytecode matches compilation output.
-  validate deployed bytecode matches compilation output
-  access to packages dependencies
-  construct new packages

Web3
----

The ``Package`` object will function much like the ``Contract`` class
provided by ``web3``. Rather than instantiating the base class provided
by ``ethpm``, you will instead use a ``classmethod`` which generates a
new ``Package`` class for a given package.

.. code:: python

   OwnedPackage = BasePackage.factory('/path/to/owned-v1.0.0.json')

Then, the ``OwnedPackage`` can be instantiated with any ``web3``
intance.

.. code:: python

   owned_package = OwnedPackage(web3)

A ``Package`` class can only be directly constructed from the parsed
package JSON. It can also be initialized with the package’s URI or the
local filesystem path to a package by using ``Package.from_file(path)``.

Contract Factories
------------------

Contract factories should be accessible from the package class but you
must also provide a web3 instance.

.. code:: python

   Owned = OwnedPackage.get_contract_factory(web3, 'owned')

From a package instance, they are also available as properties.

.. code:: python

   Owned = owned_package.contract_factories.owned

In cases where a contract uses a library, the contract factory will have
unlinked bytecode. The ``ethpm`` package ships with its own subclass of
``web3.contract.Contract`` with a few extra methods and properties
related to bytecode linking

.. code:: python

   >>> math = owned_package.contract_factories.math
   >>> math.has_linkable_bytecode
   True
   >>> math.is_bytecode_linked
   False
   >>> linked_math = math.link_bytecode({'MathLib': '0x1234...'})
   >>> linked_math.is_bytecode_linked
   True

..

   Note: the actual format of the link data is not clear since library
   names aren’t a one-size-fits all solution. We need the ability to
   specify specific link references in the code.

Deployed Contracts
------------------

Deployed contracts are only available from package instances. The
package instance will filter the ``deployments`` based on the chain that
``web3`` is connected to.

Accessing deployments is done with property access

.. code:: python

   package.deployed_contracts.Greeter

IPFS
----

We’ll need a pluggable backend system for IPFS access. A built-in
default one that defaults to using infura should be enough to get off
the ground.

Lower priority but important will be ensuring that a user can configure
connecting to their own IPFS node.

Verifying Things
----------------

The ``Package`` class should verify all of the following things.

-  Package json matches EthPM V2 Manifest Specification
-  Included bytecode matches compilation output
-  Deployed bytecode matches compilation output

Dependencies
------------

The ``Package`` class should provide access to the full dependency tree.

.. code:: python

   >>> owned_package.build_dependencies['zeppelin']
   <ZeppelinPackage>

Testing Strategy
----------------

-  Load and validate packages from disk.
-  Access package data.
-  Access contract factories.

Release setup
-------------

For Debian-like systems:

.. code:: sh

   apt install pandoc

To release a new version:

.. code:: sh

   make release bump=$$VERSION_PART_TO_BUMP$$

How to bumpversion
------------------

The version format for this repo is ``{major}.{minor}.{patch}`` for
stable, and ``{major}.{minor}.{patch}-{stage}.{devnum}`` for unstable
(``stage`` can be alpha or beta).

To issue the next version in line, specify which part to bump, like
``make release bump=minor`` or ``make release bump=devnum``.

If you are in a beta version, ``make release bump=stage`` will switch to
a stable.

To issue an unstable version when the current version is stable, specify
the new version explicitly, like
``make release bump="--new-version 4.0.0-alpha.1 devnum"``
